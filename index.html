                    <br>
                    <p>When I'm creating websites, I search a variety of places
                        for inspiration. It is common for me to go to other web
                        developers and designers for ideas and inspiration.
                        Furthermore, I like to keep up with the latest
                        developments in web design, like responsive design,
                        minimalism, and user-centered development. When creating
                        a website, I also draw inspiration from the intended
                        audience, the goals of the website, and its content. In
                        the end, I use my own creativity and knowledge to
                        produce unique and avant-garde designs.
